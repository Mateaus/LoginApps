# LoginApps
Android Application

What I learned from this:
- How to utilize Firebase in different ways.
  - Authenticating accounts in order to Log in into the application and check for role.
  - Registration system in order to register accounts with an authentication token and a role.
  - Verification of email in order to be able to Log in.
  - Password recovery option in order to reset user's password through an email link.
  - How to use DatabaseReference in order to write or store information into the Firebase Database to utilize that information for multiple purposes.
  - How to fetch the data written in the Firebase Database in order to direct account into an specific UI.
  - How to utilize listeners in order to constantly check whether if an account is authenticated or not.
  - Small implementation and understanding of Rules from the Firebase Database in order to read or write into the Database.
  - A general understanding on how Rules from Firebase Database work alongside the listeners in order to check if an account can read or write.
- A general understanding on how Room Database works.
- A general understanding on how recycler activity works in order to implement and create new slides.
  
Purpose and how I got to this:
- I wanted to learn how to store information written from inside the application in order to then utilize that information for different
purposes. 
- I began by looking at multiple options as how to how to do this since I had zero knowledge in regards to this so my first 
approach was to create a log in system with an SQL server. After spending multiple days learning and working on it. It ended up
not working the way I initially wanted to and decided to spend more hours looking around for a different approach.
- The second approach was to use Room Database in order to store information into my phone to keep a list of information stored in 
the phone. (Which I later thought It would be a better idea to use Firebase Database to store the information being stored in the phone
in order to keep it as a backup in case the phone's memory gets deleted).
- Lastly, I found Firebase which I found to be really good and decided to spend days upon days just learning how to implement it into
an Android application. Until I finally got the hang of it and managed to create what I currenty have here. I would of loved to continue
but I had to stop because the school semester was beginning.
